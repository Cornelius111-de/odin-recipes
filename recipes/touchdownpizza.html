    <h1>Touchdown Pizza</h1>

    <p>My favorite sports pub serves this, and I've come up with a simple and delicious home version. Many local
        restaurants sell wing sauce, and most grocery stores carry it near the steak and BBQ sauces. It's rich, so serve
        in squares as an appetizer. Serve ranch dressing, celery, and carrot sticks on the side. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package prebaked pizza crust (such as Boboli®)</li>
        <li>1 cup diced cooked chicken breast</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Buffalo wing sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup Buffalo wing sauce</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package crumbled blue cheese</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

            <p>Spread 1/2 cup wing sauce on the pizza crust; top with blue cheese, chicken mixture, and celery. Cover

            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is cooked through and cheese is bubbling, about 12 minutes. Cool
